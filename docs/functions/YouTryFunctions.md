# Named functions
* Create a function `tupler` that takes a comma-separated line with two entries and returns a two-tuple.
     * So the string `foo,bar` should return `('foo','bar')`
     * If bad input is provided, the function should return None

# Functions as first-class objects
* Write a function `x_pow`, that given a base, returns a function with one argument n allowing us to print base raised to nth power
```python
two_pow = x_pow(2)
two_pow(2)
4
```
