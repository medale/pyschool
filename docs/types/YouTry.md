# Strings
* Create the string 'Hello, Python World' as hw
* Create slice that returns just 'Hello'
* Create slice that returns just 'World'
* How could you create list \['Hello', ' Python World'\] from hw?
* How many characters in hw?
* Return last letter in hw
* Return first letter in hw
* Create a list with all letters of hw \['H', 'e', 'l',...\]
* Create a list with all letters of hw in lower case \['h', 'e', 'l',...\]
* Create new string 'Hi, Python World' from hw (did this change hw?)
* Create a list with all ASCII lower case letters

# Lists
* Create list `one` containing the letters 'a' and 'b' using []
* Create list `two` containing the letters 'c', 'd', 'e' using list()
* Create variables `a` and `b` by unpacking list `one`
* What happens if we try to unpack `a`,`b`,`c` on list `one`?
* Create a new list `three` containing all elements of `one` and `two`
* Modify list `one` to also include all elements of `two`
* How many elements does list `one` contain now?
* Insert element 'aa' right after the first 'a' in list `one`
* Remove all elements from `one`
* Create a list `nums` with numbers 1 to 20
* Create a new list of all even numbers from `nums`
* Make a shallow copy of the even numbers list

# Dictionaries
* Create an empty dictionary
* Create a dictionary with entries ('the':5) and ('foo':1) as `word_counts`
* Return the value of the key 'the'
* Update the count of 'the' to 6.
* Remove the key 'foo'
* Add key 'bar' with value 7
* How many keys in `word_counts`?
* Remove all entries from `word_counts`
* Given the following two lists, create a dictionary country:capital:
     * `countries = ['USA','France','Germany']`
     * `capitols = ['Washington, D.C.', 'Paris', 'Berlin']`
* Using a dictionary for comprehension, create a new dictionary with entries:
     * country (key): number of characters in capitol (value)
     * Expected dict: `{'USA': 16, 'Germany': 6, 'France': 5}`

# Sets
* Create an empty set
* Create a set with elements 1, 2, 3 as set1
* Create another set with elements 3, 4, 5 as set2
* What is the set that contains all elements from set1 and set2?
* What are the elements that set1 and set2 have in common?
* Modify set1 to contain all elements of set1 AND set2
* Remove the number 3 from set1
* Create a list with the unique elements in [1,2,3,3,3,4,2,1] (any order)
