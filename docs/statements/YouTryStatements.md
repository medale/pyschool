# If/for loops
* Start with `my_list = [1, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9]`. Use appropriate if structure to create three lists. 
     * one with numbers x <= 3
     * one with 4 <= x <= 7
     * one with numbers x >= 8 
* Write a for loop that iterates over `my_list` and returns the first number > 5.
* Write a for loop that iterates over `my_list` and returns numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3.
