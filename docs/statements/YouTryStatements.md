Create a file 'you_try_statements.py' under .../pyschool and
run your solutions in the Python console.

# If/for loops
* Start with `my_list = [1, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9]`. Use appropriate if-structure to create three lists. 
     * one with numbers x <= 3
     * one with 4 <= x <= 7
     * one with numbers x >= 8 
* Write a for loop that iterates over `my_list` and returns the first number > 5.
* Write a for loop that iterates over `my_list` and returns numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3.
* Write a for loop that counts how many lines there are in docs/samples/ApacheFoundation.html
* Write a for loop that prints all lines that contain the string 'Python' in docs/samples/ApacheFoundation.html

# Comprehensions/iterables
* Write a list comprehension that squares each number in `my_list = [1, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9]`, i.e. `[1, 36...]`
* Using a dictionary comprehension create a dictionary matching `['a','b','c']` keys to `[1,2,3]` values.

# Functions on iterables
* Create a new list that is sorted from `my_list = [1, 6, 5, 7, 3, 4, 9]` (my_list unchanged)
* Sort `my_list` in place in reverse order (9,7...)
* Find sum of all numbers, max and min numbers from `my_list`
